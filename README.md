What is it?

A helpful productivity tool. Here's roughly how the technique works:

- You work hard for intense "mini sprints" of 25 minutes each. These are called a Pomodoro. For each Pomodoro you set a small goal that you must accomplish.
- After each Pomodoro, you take a short break of around 3 - 5 minutes.
- After each 4 Pomodoro's, you take a long break of around 15 - 30 minutes.

Written in C#, targets .NET 4.0. Built some time ago for internal usage, in a rather small amount of time so please excuse the quality of the code. :)
